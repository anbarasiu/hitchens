Sometimes I travel to the past  

In short term trips triggered  

By longing that shadows cast  

When destiny gets to snigger  

Oh no, destiny did say I?  

For, believe I not in the beast,  

In a world fueled by power of I  

Unless the effort is ceased.  

Trials of creative endeavour  

Battered though by routine’s rut  

Into a state of cunning devour  

Stringing into a series of but.  

When can the mind crawl-wander?  

Sneaking in and out of pits of wonder,  

Without any shame and guilt  

Thrust by traps of structure built  

Over years and bundled into badges  

Of customs, traditions and culture  

Flattening all individual’s edges  

Into a shape not one’s signature  

Flashing lights of alarm when  

Any outlier is on verge of incoming  

The badges desire not competence  

But only indistinguishable compliance  

Only so that none rises above the rest  

And preserve harmony of the thoughtless nest.  

Ponder over the meaning of life  

In constant pursuit only to unravel  

A meaninglessness of existence  

In a world of uncertain free will  

In bubbles of prejudices and influences  

The only morality then being  

Integrity, love and virtue upholding  

In beliefs of strength and curiosity  

And never to waver in tranquility.
