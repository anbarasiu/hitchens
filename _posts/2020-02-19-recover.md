I had forgotten the feels  
Of many bad days in a row  
Until -  
All my daily apps  
Struck on a united front  
\
Unfathomable how they met  
The sneaky PMS devil  
Whose only wish is  
Me weeping on a sidewalk  
And climbing into chasm dark  
\
And do it, I wanted to badly,  
Void of my everyday riches  
Of endorphin loots and highs  
Instead chained by payment failures  
And overflowing greyed out classes  
\
Trudging back in despair  
I tumbled into a rabbit hole  
Of Youtube instrumental covers  
Complementing cake of chocolate  
While tucked under covers  
\
Is there a moral to the tale?  
Despair never, for there are  
More apps that never pale  
To feed daily quests  
Of gratification.
