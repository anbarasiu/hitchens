To be alive. What does it mean to be alive? What does it feel to be alive?  
\
To feel the light breeze touch your skin, as it brushes past in its own quest of a spot to dissolve into.  
\
To feel the ink on the paper glide, like the flower detached from its stalk and effortlessly spiralling along, with the journey of the breeze.  
\
To watch the tiniest leaves rustle in the rhythmic sway of their branches and the joy in being able to discern the multitudes of shades of green among them.  
\
To hear the chirps from within the branches that leave behind an echo near the ear drums, that reverberate their way into the heart and fade into its own beats.  
\
To see the kites gliding with grace in their own preferred layers of the atmosphere and feel a lightness pervading through the body.  
\
To feel the joy of growing up in a rush of a million memories condensed into seconds, at the sight of young buds on plant saplings.  
\
To watch an older person walk past with a content smile and feel connected to the all the other people in the world, just by sharing the same content smile.  
\
To be mad at the revving of engines that tear through the tranquility and wonder why we cannot have all silent EVs.  
\
To sit still and let the mind wander, ignoring the urges of busy work and fading into a calm nothingness.  
\
To catch glimpses as the mundane unfolds itself and morphs into matrices of meaning.  
\
To wonder about the acuteness of feeling that comes from two weeks of distracting pain and a lingering numbness into chaos.  
\
To feel alive, you need to feel dead once in a while.
