Crawling through thorny bushes I am,  
For I know, across it lies the glam,  
Of sparkling ripples in the moonlight, yet  
With the vast expanse of stillness at night  
Over which hangs the breeze.  
Soar I will, through the freeze,  
Deserting deeds of tutelage for the base  
All that are daunted by prospects of any grace,  
Prancing around to pick up true hearts  
While muting the noises of villainous darts  
Rip off the masks of black  
With words of integrity that they lack  
Seeking out in solidarity, to hold hands  
That belong with lips that yell ‘Time’s up!’  
Retreat and let,  
Atlas shrug again.  
Perhaps more than let,  
Atlas shrug again.
