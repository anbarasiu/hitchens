I am me.
But my mind? Not!
Subdue, how?

This restless ape -
Running acrobatics on
Thought branches
Munch-munch through
Low-hanging fruits.

Streamline...
Streamline into strings
Of beads of words.

Like the renowned snake,
I garland self.

Awaiting slumber, promising
Reveries of rainbow.

Colours not numbered, and
Snooze into oblivion
With a determined smile.
