Beliefs â€” they do differ;  
Your belief and my lack thereof  
In an entity invisible  
The lack born from crunching of  
Curiosity preprocessors non-stop,  
In motion from childhood.  
\
Reason awakened to values as  
The only ideals to uphold necessary  
As was preached by all propaganda  
Shunning instruments extricated of ideals,  
Blindly propagated blank instruments and  
Archaic practices without rationale.  
\
Curiosity branched into scepticism  
Fueled by the mob mandates  
Of opinions and individual stands.  
\
Though not held by absolutes  
When in the way comes, love  
Accompany I shall, to share  
Moments, as everything else  
Participate, expect not, to not  
Wallow in judgement or deception,  
Detest not, my independent thought  
In harmony shall we live with rationale.
