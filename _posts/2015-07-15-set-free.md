Flailing amid ghosts of uncertainty  
In the throes of thwarted ambitions  
Bound to thy sentiments; let go me!  
\
Soar I, in the illusion of wings sprouted  
Departing the canopy into the clouds  
Grounded though, in reality, I was  
Crashing came the unwitting cognizance -  
Toils of conformity from love or remorse;  
Bound though, bound thee, never free.  
\
Weakness of the single moment, fear I  
Haunt it will, with a shrewd eye,  
Mocking the oxymorons that are I.  
\
Morph into a snake that sheds at will  
Conceal in a cocoon, coward-like  
Retract into a shell, far from sight  
Burrow into grounds, deep inside  
Options check off I, into oblivion  
Born I was into something, nought else.  
\
Remove again the cord, as from the womb,  
Reborn I shall be and survive.
