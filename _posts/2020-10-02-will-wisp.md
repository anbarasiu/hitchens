Flashing glow and muffled screams  
from the television in the corner  
rather than nature awakening senses,  
Slightly swearing under her breath  
with the creaking of her bed  
Ye Wenjie dragged herself out,  
Watching flames of injustice rise  
ironically into the redeeming dawn  
through the golden window above,  
Horrified at the void left behind by  
Another woman and her dignity,  
She though frozen and trembling  
felt calm in justification for  
the cry for help she’d cast,  
To lives not of human origin —   
Will-o’-the-wisp though maybe  
Humanity needs saving  
or ending.  
\
We do not know if Ye Wenjie felt remorse, but she won’t, if she saw the things happening at Hathras and around.  
\
Inktober 2020. Wisp.
