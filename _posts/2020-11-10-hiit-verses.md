Dusk is cozying into the dark  
It’s wintry in a rainy aftermath  
Brain’s running pattern matching  
Triggered by variables of weather  
Led on by the subconscious —  
Shoes for running, now I’m wearing  
Stretching myself to warm against  
The mental map of my running stretch  
Hopping on foam soles to  
Warm up for a run in intervals

Stomp  
Trot  
Jog  
There are no dogs — forward  
There are no lights — turn around  
There are less humans — forward  
There are no humans — turn around  
Pant  
Breathe  
Recover

Stomp  
Trot  
Jog  
There is my stretch — a park; jog ahead  
The sparse lights are going out — turn around  
A distant bike is revving near — turn around  
Or wait and watch it pull ahead — forward  
Pant  
Breathe  
Recover

Stomp  
Trot  
Jog  
Listening to the racing heart  
In it’s rhythm to racing neurons  
In futile pursuit of a safe course  
Ensconced in thorny vines of hope  
Pant  
Breathe  
Recover

Stomp  
Trot  
Jog  
Tracker states five intervals of anxiety  
I am crying, this not a world for all  
Why cannot it be safe for all?

Stomp  
Trot  
Jog  
There is a stretch — familiar; forward  
There are many lights — jog ahead  
I am crying, happy, easing as  
Endorphins flush out anxiety  
Pant  
Breathe  
Recover

Finally from the welcome exhaustion  
Of marking territory with sweat  
Still shrouded in crowding thoughts  
Of how do we make it safe for all.

Waking up at midnight to wrap memories of my recent interval run of misery in a layer of poetry, or rather to sandwich so-called-poetry into Intervals.
